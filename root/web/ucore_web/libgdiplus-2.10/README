libgdiplus: An Open Source implementation of the GDI+ API.

This is part of the Mono project - http://mono-project.com

Requirements:

	This requires the libraries used by the Cairo vector graphics library
	to build (freetype2, fontconfig, Xft2 and libpng, basically).
	See cairo/README. Note that libpixman is included in this package already.

	If the system cairo is newer than the bundled version (1.6.4) provided
	by libgdiplus then the newer version will be used

To build:

	./configure --prefix=YOUPREFIX
	make

To install:

	make install

Optional build options [UNSUPPORTED]

	--with-pango

	This build libgdiplus using Pango to render (measure and draw) 
	all of it's text. This can only be enabled if libgdiplus is built
	with the *system* cairo and requires Pango version 1.10 (or later).
